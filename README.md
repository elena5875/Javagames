  ##  Html: We used the W3validator for my html code. It showed no error in the validator

##     CSS: I had my CSS code validated thru w3 validator. 


 ##   JavaScript
 ## My Java script code was validated using [code beautify](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) 
 ## It showed two errors which is 
 ## Unexpected 'const'. const quizData = [
 ## and the other one is Stopping. (0% scanned).
 
  

# Unfixed bugs
## The image that was supposed to be part of the header and background would fail to come up in github. 
## However, in my IDE the background image is present but when I pushed it on github and deploy it
## the image does not appear. I do not know how to debug this since the knowledge
## that I know so far is does not solve this issue.
